# Rubiks Cube Simulator

An interactive Rubik's cube created with pure **CSS** and **React.js**.
Cloned from user jithutholoor. His original Repo is linked [here](https://github.com/daniloorozco/rubix-cube).
> The original repo only consists of the interactive cube. I intend to implement a scramble, and solve functionality.
